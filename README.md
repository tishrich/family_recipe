This project was made for RockIT Bootcamp as a personal project. I chose to make a family recipe app.
Your Family Recipe allows a user to register and save their family recipes in a personal family cookbook. So no matter where you keep your recipes at home: in a drawer, in a scrapbook, in the pantry, a plastic ziplock bag, etc.; now you can keep them safely online in your computer's memory and pull them up whenever you want no matter where you are. Especially if your memory of what goes in grandma's secret desert dish is fading like that piece of paper you wrote it on.

As an MVP we were asked to make at least one CRUD, or CRU.
Users can create a recipe, view it, and finally update it.

Since this is a personal project I wanted to incorporate a clean and fun design, and include some of my favorite design aspects.
